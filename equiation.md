Hence with ∣Wk(x,y) ∣=k2, window is completely contained in Ω.
Using Integral images (first presented by Crow [7] and later formalized by Viola and Jones [8]), to provide an efficient means to compute the sum of pixel intensities over arbitrary rectangular regions in constant time, we construct two integral images (summed‐area tables):
		S(u,v)=∑_(i=1)^u▒〖∑_(j=1)^v▒I(i,j) ,〗							(4)
	 〖S〗_2 (u,v)=∑_(i=1)^u▒∑_(j=1)^v▒〖I(i,j)〗^2 ,(u,v)∈Ω. 					(5)
However, work published in Computers and Electronics in Agriculture will often not comprise a straightforward experimental investigation or testing of a hypothesis.  Therefore, rather than Materials and Methods, other section headings may be appropriate.
